Test Case 1.
This test case was taken from the Asst2.pdf to gauge if our KLD/JSD were calculating properly as it is important to get a baseline that is appropriate.

	B.txt:
		Content: hi hi there there
	C.txt
		Content: hi hi out there

	KLD for B.txt: 0.06247
	KLD for C.txt: 0.0313

	JSD for B, C: 0.6247 + 0.0313 / 2 = ~0.469 (rounded)

Test Case 2.
This was a generic test case where we tested to see the KLD and JSD values of two files that were perfectly matching (aka plagiarized). 

	A.txt
		Content: a a a a
	A-copy.txt
		Content: a a a a

	KLD for A.txt: 0.0
	KLD for A-copy.txt: 0.0

	JSD for A, A-copy: 0 + 0 / 2 = 0

Test Case 3.
This was another generic test case where we tested to see the KLD and JSD values of two files that had no similarities at all (no token matching).

	A.txt
		Content: a a a a
	B.txt
		Content: b b b b

	KLD for A.txt: 0.301
	KLD for B.txt: 0.301

	JSD for A, B: 0.301 + 0.301 / 2 = 0.301

Test Case 4.
This was a test case consisting of two files that were exactly similar; however, we added characters that would not be tokenized to ensure that our token handling was correct, thus producing the correct result of a JSD of 0.0

	TestA.txt
		Content: hi 1 2 3 how are you doing 5 4 3 2 x x x d d d e 2 e e 2 e e ! ! ! ! e e e
	TestB.txt
		Content:1 2 3 hi 5 how 4 are 3 you  2 doing 5 4 3 2 x 1  x  1 x  2 d  3 d 4  d e 6 2 e e 2 e e ! ! ! ! e e e

	KLD for TestA.txt: 0.0
	KLD for TestB.txt: 0.0

	JSD for TestA, TestB: 0.0 + 0.0 / 2 = 0.0

Test Case 5.
This was a test case to see if the file would be able to handle two files that are empty.

	TestA.txt
		Content:
	TestB.txt
		Content:
	
	KLD for TestA.txt: 0.0
	KLD for TestB.txt: 0.0

	JSD for TestA, TestB: 0.0 + 0.0 / 2 = 0.0
