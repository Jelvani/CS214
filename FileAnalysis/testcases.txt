Test Case 1.
This was a generic test case where we tested to see the KLD and JSD values of two files that were perfectly matching (aka plagiarized). 

	A.txt
		Content: a a a a
	A-copy.txt
		Content: a a a a

	KLD for A.txt: 0.0
	KLD for A-copy.txt: 0.0

	JSD for A, A-copy: 0 + 0 / 2 = 0

Test Case 2.
This was another generic test case where we tested to see the KLD and JSD values of two files that had no similarities at all (no token matching).

	A.txt
		Content: a a a a
	B.txt
		Content: b b b b

	KLD for A.txt: 0.301
	KLD for B.txt: 0.301

	JSD for A, B: 0.301 + 0.301 / 2 = 0.301
