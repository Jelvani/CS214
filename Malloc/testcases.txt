Workload D:
	This workload is meant to test failure cases that would traditionally cause conflicts
	with malloc/free. We utilized test cases provided from Asst1.pdf to denote the following
	issues that may arise with user input.

	char *p = malloc(5000);
	
	This should fail as the malloc size we are requesting is larger than we can allocate.

	char *t = malloc(100);
	free(t);
	free(t);

	This should fail due to the fact that we already freed t in the second line; however,
	try to call free on the t pointer. This should return an error to the user.

	char *j = malloc(200);
	free(j + 10);

	This should return an error because we are accessing a block of memory that is not allocated
	to j. 

Workload E:
	In workload E, we are looking to test the efficiency of our merging, as it is important
	for malloc to handle merging of blocks that are not utilized.

	Bounds: testArray has a fixed size of 4094 (MEM SIZE - META SIZE).

	We start by randomly generating a number from 1-59, and mallocing this to our testArray.
	
	After we store data to the array, we cycle through the array and make a decision based on
	a random integer.

		If the integer equals 0, continue.
		If the integer equals 1, free that memory block and set the block in the array as null.

	This is important as it allows us to implement the idea of fragmentation where multiple blocks
	can be located to one another and should be merged together.

	Post free, we randomly choose a number from 29-59 and try to malloc these values. We choose a bigger
	value to force the program to generate bigger blocks if need be.

	After this, we free the entirety of the array as the test is concluded.
