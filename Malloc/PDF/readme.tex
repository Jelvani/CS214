This document is project assignment 1: ++Malloc for Systems Programming (01:198:214) at Rutgers University - Fall 2020.
\end{flushleft}
\end{abstract}

\section{Setup your Environment}
Within Asst0.tgz file, we have four files that are utilized to run ++Malloc. 

\begin{flushleft}
$\textbf{mymalloc.c}$: This is the file that has our methods of $\emph{mymalloc()}$ and $\emph{myfree()}$ to demonstrate the purpose of this assignment. 
\end{flushleft}

\begin{flushleft}
$\textbf{mymalloc.h}$: This is a header file which allows us to link methods between files.
\end{flushleft}

\begin{flushleft}
$\textbf{memgrind.c}$: This is the primary testing environment for our program. Within this file, we have five different tests and our output to demonstrate the overall efficiency of our program.
\end{flushleft}

\begin{flushleft}
$\textbf{Makefile}$: This file allows us to compile and remove the program.
\end{flushleft}

\begin{flushleft}
To begin: place mymalloc.c, mymalloc.h, memgrind.c, and Makefile all into the same directory on the iLab machine. Within terminal, type "$\emph{make}$" which will generate an executable called 'memgrind'.
\end{flushleft}

\begin{flushleft}
To clean the document, you can type "$\emph{make clean}$" in the terminal, and this will remove the executable memgrind, and any associating files that are related to running memgrind.
\end{flushleft}

\section{Running ++Malloc}
To run this program, we can type "$\emph{./memgrind}$" into terminal after we have used the make command in the previous section. Arguments are not required to run this program, however, you may utilize "$\emph{$>$ output.txt}$" to store the output into a file called output.txt which would be in the same directory as the program rather than looking at the output in terminal.

\begin{flushleft}
Once ran, we can expect some output generated that will demonstrate the overall effectiveness of the program. Below is a description of each test labeled from A to E to denote what we were testing with the program.
\end{flushleft}

\begin{flushleft}
$\textbf{Test A}$: For 120 iterations, we had to malloc() 1 byte, and immediately free it.
\end{flushleft}

\begin{flushleft}
$\textbf{Test B}$: For 120 iterations, fill up an array where each index of the array is a single byte that has been malloc(). Once the array has been filled, iterate through the array, and free each 1 byte pointer.
\end{flushleft}

\begin{flushleft}
$\textbf{Test C}$: For 240 iterations, randomly choose between malloc() or free() a single byte; however, there are restrictions. Our first restriction: you cannot free() a byte that has not been malloc'd. Our second restriction: once 120 bytes have been malloc'd, immediately free the remainder of the bytes.
\end{flushleft}

\begin{flushleft}
$\textbf{Test D}$: This workload is meant to test failure cases that would traditionally cause conflicts with malloc/free. We utilized test cases provided from Asst1.pdf to denote the following issues that may arise with user input.
\end{flushleft}

\begin{flushleft}
$\textbf{Test E}$: In workload E, we are looking to test the efficiency of our merging, as it is important for malloc to handle merging of blocks that are not utilized. Please view $\emph{testcases.txt}$ for a more elaborate explaination of workload E.
\end{flushleft}

\begin{flushleft}
Each workload will be completed 50 times, and total time will be accumlated and divided by total workload to obtain average time for workload to complete. The output display will show the average, slowest, and total runtime for each workload from A to E. The units that these tests are measured in are $\mu$s.
\end{flushleft}

\section{Design Implementation}
In this section, we will discuss the design implementation in regarding metadata design and any other features that we deemed needed more explaination.
